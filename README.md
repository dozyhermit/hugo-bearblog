# Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog ![Test](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

This is a fork of [this](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) great template.

Changes include:

- Blog is at the index, instead of the blog being at `/blog`
- Blog page pagination
- Optional archive page (just a list of all posts, no pagination)
- Optional copyright on footer
- Prettier opinionated formatting

Go give them some love.
